# Architecture Overview — Future Systems Lab

Future Systems Lab uses a modular digital-health architecture built across:

- Identity and access control (DID/VC + RBAC)
- Consent governance and decentralized authorization
- Orthomolecular AI inference models
- Wearable physiological sensing (NeuroBalance Watch)
- Session storage and audit logging
- Blockchain token and NFT mechanisms
- BI analytics and data-layer pipelines

Each subsystem is documented in detail:

- Full Ecosystem Diagram
- Blockchain Layer
- Security & Privacy Layer
- Wearables Architecture
- AI / Orthomolecular Pipeline
- Consent Architecture
- BI / Data Warehouse Flow

This layered approach enables decentralized, transparent, and composable digital-health prototypes at production scale.
