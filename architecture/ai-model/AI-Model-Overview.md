# 🤖 AI Model Layer — Overview (Phase 1)

The AI layer provides predictive insights, anomaly detection, and personalized recommendations across the Future Systems Lab ecosystem. This module interacts with:

- The **Data Layer** (mock lab results, orthomolecular tables, cognitive baselines)
- The **Blockchain Layer** (session hashes, integrity proofs)
- The **Wearables Layer** (micro-patterns from sensors)
- The **Security & Privacy Layer** (zero-exposure architecture)

This document initializes the AI architecture and prepares for model definition.

## 1.0 AI Model Scope (Phase 1)

This phase creates the foundation for:

- Input schema definition
- Data normalization pipelines
- Embedding + feature engineering recipe
- Model selection roadmap (decision trees, gradient boosting, hybrid LLM embeddings)
- Output structure (scores, flags, explanations)

No training occurs in this phase. We are defining the system.

## 2.0 Current Inputs (Prototype)

- Mock orthomolecular lab table
- Mock metabolic/serotonin/cofactor indicators
- Symptom tags
- Wearable micro-pattern placeholders
- Smart contract–fixed event hashes

These will later be synthesized into a **unified feature vector** powering the recommendation engine.

## 3.0 Planned Components (Next Phases)

### Phase 2 — Data Pipelines
Define:
- Feature extraction
- Scalers / normalizers
- Hash validators
- Missing-data rules

### Phase 3 — ML Model
Select and prototype:
- Gradient Boosted Trees
- Rule-based biochemical logic engine
- Optional small LLM adapter layer

### Phase 4 — Model Outputs
Produce:
- State profile
- Neurochemical recommendations
- Risk flags
- Progression probabilities
- Hash validation proof links
