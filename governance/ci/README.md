# CI Governance Controls

EncryptHealth CI enforces:

- Linting (Terraform, YAML, JSON)
- Formatting checks
- Security scanning
- OPA/Rego policy evaluation (audit-only)
- Large-file detection
- Markdown and documentation integrity

These checks ensure that every commit maintains governance alignment and system reproducibility.
